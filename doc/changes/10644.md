- Add support for the -H flag (introduced in Ocaml compiler 5.2) in dune
  (only supported for lang versions 3.17 and higher). This  adaptation gives
  the correct semantics for `implicit_transitive_deps = false` mode, since then
  transitive dependencies are included with -H flag and so are not directly accessible
  but visible for the compiler. (#10644, fixes (#9333, #ocsigen/tyxml#274, #2733, #4963),
